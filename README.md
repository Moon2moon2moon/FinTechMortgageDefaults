# FinTechs in the Home Mortgage Market

This project examines how FinTechs can more accurately assess the reliability of potential lenders by leveraging non-traditional/non-financial trust indicators found in a prospect's digital footprint. The data is sourced from the home mortgage cohort of 2021Q1 from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unfortunately, the datasets involved are far too large to be uploaded to GitHub (>1GB), but sections of the relevant datasets can be viewed in the provided files.
